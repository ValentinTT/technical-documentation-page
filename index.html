      <header>Syntax Errors</header>
      <p>Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still
        learning Python:</p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; while True print('Hello world') 
  File "&#60;stdin&#62;", line 1 
    while True print('Hello world') 
                   ^ 
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
      <p>The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where
        the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow: in the example,
        the error is detected at the function
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" target="_blank">print()</a>, since a colon (':') is missing before it. File name and line number are printed so you know where to
        look in case the input came from a script.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Exceptions">
      <header>Exceptions</header>
      <p>Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute
        it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn
        how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error
        messages as shown here:</p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; 10 * (1/0) 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "&#60;stdin&#62;", line 1, in &#60;module&#62;
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero 
&#62;&#62;&#62; 4 + spam*3 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "&#60;stdin&#62;", line 1, in &#60;module&#62;
NameError: name 'spam' is not defined 
&#62;&#62;&#62; '2' + 2 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "&#60;stdin&#62;", line 1, in&#60;module&#62;
TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly</code></pre>
      <p>The last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed
        as part of the message: the types in the example are
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError" target="_blank">ZeroDivisionError</a>,
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError" target="_blank">NameError</a> and
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError" target="_blank">TypeError</a>. The string printed as the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that occurred. This
        is true for all built-in exceptions, but need not be true for user-defined exceptions (although it is a useful convention).
        Standard exception names are built-in identifiers (not reserved keywords).</p>
      <p>The rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception and what caused it.
      </p>
      <p>The preceding part of the error message shows the context where the exception happened, in the form of a stack traceback.
        In general it contains a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will not display lines read from standard
        input.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions" target="_blank">Built-in Exceptions</a> lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Handling_Exceptions">
      <header>Handling Exceptions</header>
      <p>It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks the user
        for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using Control-C or
        whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt" target="_blank">KeyboardInterrupt</a>KeyboardInterrupt exception.
      </p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; while True:
...     try:
...         x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
...         break
...     except ValueError:
...         print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")
...</code></pre>
      <p>The
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> statement works as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, the try clause (the statement(s) between the
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> and
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except" target="_blank">except</a> keywords) is executed.</li>
        <li>If no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of the
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> statement is finished. </li>
        <li>If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its type matches
          the exception named after the
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except" target="_blank">except</a> keyword, the except clause is executed, and then execution continues after the
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> statement. </li>
        <li>If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, it is passed on to outer
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> statements; if no handler is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops with a message as
          shown above.
        </li>
        <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> statement may have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for different exceptions. At most one
        handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding try clause, not in other
        handlers of the same
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> statement. An except clause may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, for example:</p>
      <pre><code>... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):
...     pass</code></pre>
      <p>A class in an
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except" target="_blank">except</a> clause is compatible with an exception if it is the same class or a base class thereof (but not the other
        way around — an except clause listing a derived class is not compatible with a base class). For example, the following
        code will print B, C, D in that order:
      </p>
      <pre><code>class B(Exception):
    pass

class C(B):
    pass

class D(C):
    pass

for cls in [B, C, D]:
    try:
        raise cls()
    except D:
        print("D")
    except C:
        print("C")
    except B:
        print("B")</code></pre>
      <p>Note that if the except clauses were reversed (with except B first), it would have printed B, B, B — the first matching
        except clause is triggered.</p>
      <p>The last except clause may omit the exception name(s), to serve as a wildcard. Use this with extreme caution, since
        it is easy to mask a real programming error in this way! It can also be used to print an error message and then re-raise
        the exception (allowing a caller to handle the exception as well):
      </p>
      <pre><code>import sys

try:
    f = open('myfile.txt')
    s = f.readline()
    i = int(s.strip())
except OSError as err:
    print("OS error: {0}".format(err))
except ValueError:
    print("Could not convert data to an integer.")
except:
    print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
    raise</code></pre>
      <p>The
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> …
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except" target="_blank">except</a> statement has an optional else clause, which, when present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful
        for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    try:
        f = open(arg, 'r')
    except OSError:
        print('cannot open', arg)
    else:
        print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
        f.close()</code></pre>
      <p>The use of the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#else" target="_blank">else</a> clause is better than adding additional code to the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected
        by the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> …
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except" target="_blank">except</a> statement.
      </p>
      <p>When an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also known as the exception’s argument. The presence and
        type of the argument depend on the exception type.
      </p>
      <p>The except clause may specify a variable after the exception name. The variable is bound to an exception instance with
        the arguments stored in instance.args. For convenience, the exception instance defines
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__" target="_blank">__str__()</a> so the arguments can be printed directly without having to reference .args. One may also instantiate
        an exception first before raising it and add any attributes to it as desired.
      </p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; try:
...     raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')
... except Exception as inst:
...     print(type(inst))    # the exception instance
...     print(inst.args)     # arguments stored in .args
...     print(inst)          # __str__ allows args to be printed directly,
...                          # but may be overridden in exception subclasses
...     x, y = inst.args     # unpack args
...     print('x =', x)
...     print('y =', y)
...
&#60;class 'Exception'&#62;
('spam', 'eggs')
('spam', 'eggs')
x = spam
y = eggs</code></pre>
      <p>If an exception has arguments, they are printed as the last part (‘detail’) of the message for unhandled exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>Exception handlers don’t just handle exceptions if they occur immediately in the try clause, but also if they occur
        inside functions that are called (even indirectly) in the try clause. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; def this_fails():
...     x = 1/0
...
&#62;&#62;&#62; try:
...     this_fails()
... except ZeroDivisionError as err:
...     print('Handling run-time error:', err)
...
Handling run-time error: division by zero</code></pre>

    <section class="main-section" id="Raising_Exceptions">
      <header>Raising Exceptions</header>
      <p>The
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise" target="_blank">raise</a>raise statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; raise NameError('HiThere')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&#60;stdin&#62;", line 1, in &#60;module&#62;
NameError: HiThere</code></pre>
      <p>The sole argument to
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise" target="_blank">raise</a>raise indicates the exception to be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception class
        (a class that derives from
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception" target="_blank"></a>Exception). If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by calling its constructor with
        no arguments:
      </p>
      <pre><code>raise ValueError  # shorthand for 'raise ValueError()'</code></pre>
      <p>If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don’t intend to handle it, a simpler form of the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise" target="_blank">raise</a>raise statement allows you to re-raise the exception:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; try:
...     raise NameError('HiThere')
... except NameError:
...     print('An exception flew by!')
...     raise
...
An exception flew by!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&#60;stdin&#62;", line 2, in &#60;module&#62;
NameError: HiThere</code></pre>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="User-defined_Exceptions">
      <header>User-defined Exceptions</header>
      <p>Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class (see
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes" target="_blank">Classes</a> for more about Python classes). Exceptions should typically be derived from the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception" target="_blank">Exception</a> class, either directly or indirectly.
      </p>
      <p>Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do, but are usually kept simple, often only
        offering a number of attributes that allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for the exception.
        When creating a module that can raise several distinct errors, a common practice is to create a base class for exceptions
        defined by that module, and subclass that to create specific exception classes for different error conditions:
      </p>
      <pre><code>class Error(Exception):
    """Base class for exceptions in this module."""
    pass

class InputError(Error):
    """Exception raised for errors in the input.

    Attributes:
        expression -- input expression in which the error occurred
        message -- explanation of the error
    """

    def __init__(self, expression, message):
        self.expression = expression
        self.message = message

class TransitionError(Error):
    """Raised when an operation attempts a state transition that's not
    allowed.

    Attributes:
        previous -- state at beginning of transition
        next -- attempted new state
        message -- explanation of why the specific transition is not allowed
    """

    def __init__(self, previous, next, message):
        self.previous = previous
        self.next = next
        self.message = message</code></pre>
      <p>Most exceptions are defined with names that end in “Error,” similar to the naming of the standard exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>Many standard modules define their own exceptions to report errors that may occur in functions they define. More information
        on classes is presented in chapter

      <p>The
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" target="_blank">try</a> statement has another optional clause which is intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed
        under all circumstances. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&#62;&#62;&#62; try:

      <header>Predefined Clean-up Actions</header>
      <p>Some objects define standard clean-up actions to be undertaken when the object is no longer needed, regardless of whether
        or not the operation using the object succeeded or failed. Look at the following example, which tries to open a file
        and print its contents to the screen.
      </p>
      <pre><code>for line in open("myfile.txt"):
    print(line, end="")</code></pre>
      <p>The problem with this code is that it leaves the file open for an indeterminate amount of time after this part of the
        code has finished executing. This is not an issue in simple scripts, but can be a problem for larger applications.
        The
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" target="_blank">with</a> statement allows objects like files to be used in a way that ensures they are always cleaned up promptly
        and correctly.
      </p>
      <pre><code>with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line, end="")</code></pre>
      <p>After the statement is executed, the file f is always closed, even if a problem was encountered while processing the
        lines. Objects which, like files, provide predefined clean-up actions will indicate this in their documentation.
